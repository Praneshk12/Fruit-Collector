# Fruit-Collector
This is a game based on what I learned in class(databases and how I can incorporate them in my games).
To play this game, open it in two tabs and enter a different name in each one. 
Then try to get all the fruits in your basket until you win. 
It's not officially two player yet, but I'm working on it!
